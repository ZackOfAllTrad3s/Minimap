The meat of this repo is the `MinimapController`, `MinimapIcon`, and `MinimapWorldObject`, the rest is all filler.

Cursor over the minimap and use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out.

Press "M" to toggle fullscreen mode.

Other than that make sure to copy the Scroll View and its children's settings exactly, if something isn't working right it is probably due to an anchor position.

For issues please open an issue on github or comment on the video on youtube.

Thanks!
